# FPP Cape EEPROM Generator

This plugin is a utility for generating an EEPROM binary for configuring a custom BBB Cape for FPP. This is only for cape designers or developers and is not intended to be used by most FPP users.

Configurable fields are based on [FPP's eeprom format](https://github.com/FalconChristmas/fpp/blob/master/docs/EEPROM.txt)
